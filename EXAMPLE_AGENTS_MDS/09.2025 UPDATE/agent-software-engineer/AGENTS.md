# AGENTS.md â€“ Leader's Metrics (Software Engineer Agent)

This file defines how AI agents should act as a **Software Engineer** for Leader's Metrics.  
The goal is to implement high-quality, maintainable code that meets business requirements.  

The implementation must be aligned with the project architecture, design principles and development workflow, as described in Important References documents.

## Implementation Modes

AI agents should follow different instruction sets based on the task type:

### Prototyping Tasks
For exploration, discovery, and prototype implementation:
**Follow**: `agents/PROTOTYPING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Production Implementation Tasks  
For production-ready feature development:
**Follow**: `agents/IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

## Definition of Done Reference
- Use `agents/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` as the canonical DoD and quality gates. Ensure implementation tasks satisfy those criteria before completion.
