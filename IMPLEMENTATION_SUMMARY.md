## üåü Universal Principles Included

These principles are preserved in templates because they apply to ALL well-structured projects:

### Architecture
1. **Service Layer Pattern** - Business logic separated from HTTP handlers
2. **Separation of Concerns** - Each layer has single responsibility
3. **Type Safety** - Strong typing at boundaries
4. **Dependency Direction** - Dependencies flow inward
5. **Explicit Over Implicit** - Code is clear and obvious

### Testing
1. **Test Pyramid** - More unit, fewer integration, minimal E2E
2. **AAA Pattern** - Arrange, Act, Assert
3. **Mock Only Boundaries** - Don't mock business logic
4. **Determinism** - Tests always produce same results
5. **Tests Ship with Features** - Not separate tasks
6. **What NOT to Test** - Don't test frameworks

### Workflow
1. **Incremental Development** - Small, frequent commits
2. **Quality Gates** - All checks pass before merge
3. **Refactoring is Required** - Leave code better
4. **Documentation Updates** - Keep docs current
5. **Manual Testing** - Verify acceptance criteria

### Task Management
1. **Task Independence** - One branch, one deployable task
2. **Clear Acceptance Criteria** - Specific, testable conditions
3. **Simplicity First** - Minimal implementation, iterate
4. **Tests Non-Optional** - Part of every feature task
5. **Architecture Compliance** - Follow established patterns
