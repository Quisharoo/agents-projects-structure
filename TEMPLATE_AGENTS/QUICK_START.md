# Quick Start Guide

Get your AI agent framework up and running in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Copy Template to Your Project

```bash
# Copy the template to your project as 'agents/'
cp -r TEMPLATE_AGENTS your-project/agents

# Copy the tasks template too
cp -r TEMPLATE_AGENTS/tasks your-project/tasks
```

---

## Step 2: Customize 3 Essential Files

### File 1: `agents/AGENTS.md`

Replace these placeholders:
```markdown
[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]        → Your actual project name
[BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]        → One sentence about your project
[YOUR_TECH_STACK]          → List your technologies
[FRAMEWORK/LANGUAGE]       → e.g., Next.js, Django, Rails
[DATABASE]                 → e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB
[TESTING_TOOLS]            → e.g., Jest, Pytest, RSpec
```

### File 2: `agents/BUSINESS_REQUIREMENTS.md`

Fill in:
```markdown
[YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]        → Your project name
[TARGET_USERS]             → Who uses your app
Core Capabilities          → List 3-5 main features
Features                   → Categorize completed and planned features
Constraints                → Any technical or business constraints
```

### File 3: `agents/ARCHITECTURE.md`

Update:
```markdown
[your-project]/            → Your actual folder structure
[source-directory]/        → e.g., src/, app/, apps/
[api-or-routes]/          → Where your API code lives
[services]/               → Where business logic lives
Tech Stack                → Your actual technologies
[command]                 → Your actual commands
```

---

## Step 3: First Agent Interaction

### Try the Product Manager Agent

```
Act as the Product Manager agent for [YOUR PROJECT NAME]. 
Read agents/agent-product-manager/AGENTS.md for your instructions.

I need you to: Break down the following feature into independent tasks:
"Users should be able to login with email and password"
```

**Agent will:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- Create task files in `tasks/`
- Update `agents/ROADMAP.md`
- Provide implementation order

### Try the Software Engineer Agent

```
Act as the Software Engineer agent for [YOUR PROJECT NAME]. 
Read agents/agent-software-engineer/AGENTS.md for your instructions.

Implement the task defined in tasks/TASK-001-[name].md following production guidelines.
```

**Agent will:**
- Read task requirements
- Follow architectural standards
- Write code and tests
- Verify Definition of Done

---

## Step 4: Optional Customizations

### Customize Testing (Optional)
Edit `agents/TESTING_PRINCIPLES.md`:
- Replace `[YOUR_TEST_FRAMEWORK]` with your actual testing tools
- Update test commands
- Add framework-specific patterns

### Customize Workflow (Optional)
Edit `agents/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md`:
- Replace all `[command]` placeholders with your actual commands
- Update branch naming conventions
- Add CI/CD details

### Customize Implementation Modes (Optional)
Edit agent-software-engineer files:
- `IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Production code guidelines
- `PROTOTYPING_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Prototype guidelines

---

## Quick Reference: Commands to Customize

Find and replace these in your template files:

### Testing Commands
```
[test-command]              → npm test, pytest, go test ./...
[test-coverage-command]     → npm test -- --coverage, pytest --cov
[test-watch-command]        → npm test -- --watch, pytest-watch
```

### Development Commands
```
[dev-server-command]        → npm run dev, rails s, python manage.py runserver
[build-command]             → npm run build, go build, bundle install
[lint-command]              → npm run lint, pylint, rubocop
```

### Database Commands
```
[migrate-command]           → npm run db:migrate, rails db:migrate
[seed-command]              → npm run db:seed, rails db:seed
```

## Tips for Success

### 1. Start Small
- Customize just the 3 essential files first
- Try one agent interaction
- Refine based on experience

### 2. Be Specific
- Replace ALL placeholders
- Add project-specific details
- Include actual command examples

### 3. Keep Updated
- Update requirements as they change
- Document decisions in roadmap
- Refine processes based on learnings

### 4. Use Both Modes
- **Discovery Mode**: For uncertain features
- **Delivery Mode**: For clear requirements

### 5. Iterate
- Start basic, add detail as needed
- Refine agent instructions based on results
- Document what works for your team

---

## Troubleshooting

### Agent seems confused about project structure
**Fix**: Be more specific in `ARCHITECTURE.md` about folder structure and patterns

### Agent not following quality standards
**Fix**: Ensure `TESTING_PRINCIPLES.md` and `DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` are clear and specific

### Tasks are too vague
**Fix**: Review task template and add more specific acceptance criteria examples

### Agent writes code in wrong locations
**Fix**: Update folder structure in `ARCHITECTURE.md` and be explicit about where code lives
