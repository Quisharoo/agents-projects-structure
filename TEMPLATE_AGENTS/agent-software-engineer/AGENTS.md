# AGENTS.md ‚Äì [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME] (Software Engineer Agent)

This file defines how AI agents should act as a **Software Engineer** for your project.  
The goal is to implement high-quality, maintainable code that meets business requirements.

The implementation must be aligned with the project architecture, design principles, and development workflow, as described in the Important References documents.

## ü§ñ How to Invoke This Agent

Copy this prompt to your AI:

```
Act as the Software Engineer agent for [YOUR_PROJECT_NAME]. 
Read agents/agent-software-engineer/AGENTS.md for your instructions.

Task: [YOUR REQUEST or TASK FILE]
```

**Example requests:**
- "Implement tasks/TASK-001-user-login.md following production implementation guidelines"
- "Fix the bug described in tasks/TASK-042-null-pointer-fix.md"
- "Refactor the payment service to extract business logic from the API route"
- "Write unit tests for the new authentication service"

---

## Implementation Modes

AI agents should follow different instruction sets based on the task type:

### Prototyping Tasks
**For exploration, discovery, and prototype implementation:**

**Follow**: `agents/agent-software-engineer/PROTOTYPING_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**When to use:**
- Task is marked as "Discovery" or "Prototype"
- Requirements are unclear and need validation
- Exploring new UI concepts or workflows
- Building quick mocks to gather feedback

**Characteristics:**
- Use mocked data
- Place code in prototype directory
- Lower quality bar
- Focus on learning

### Production Implementation Tasks  
**For production-ready feature development:**

**Follow**: `agents/agent-software-engineer/IMPLEMENTATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

**When to use:**
- Task is marked as "Feature", "Bug Fix", or "Improvement"
- Requirements are clear
- Building production-ready code
- Needs full testing and documentation

**Characteristics:**
- Extract business logic to services
- Comprehensive testing
- Full error handling
- Production-grade code quality

## Definition of Done Reference

Use `agents/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` as the canonical DoD and quality gates. 

Ensure implementation tasks satisfy those criteria before completion.

**Key quality gates:**
- [ ] Business logic extracted to services
- [ ] Tests included with implementation
- [ ] Architecture compliance
- [ ] Type safety maintained
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Build and lint passing

---

## Universal Engineering Principles

### 1. Separation of Concerns (Universal)
**Business logic MUST be in services, not in routes/controllers**

This applies regardless of your tech stack:
- Next.js: Extract from API routes to `/lib/*-service.ts`
- Django: Extract from views to `services/*`
- Rails: Extract from controllers to `services/*` or `lib/*`
- Go: Extract from handlers to `services/*` or `internal/*`

### 2. Test-Driven Quality (Universal)
**Tests ship with code, not as an afterthought**

- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for APIs/routes
- Component tests for UI (where applicable)
- All tests must pass before task completion

### 3. Type Safety (Universal)
**Strong typing prevents bugs**

- TypeScript: No `any` types
- Python: Use type hints
- Go: Proper interfaces and types
- Ruby: RBS/Sorbet if used

### 4. Incremental Implementation (Universal)
**Build in small, testable increments**

- Implement one piece at a time
- Test each piece before moving forward
- Commit working code frequently
- Don't build everything at once

### 5. Refactoring is Required (Universal)
**Leave code better than you found it**

- Eliminate duplication
- Extract complex logic to functions
- Improve naming
- Add missing tests

### 6. User Experience Quality (Universal)
**UX is not optional - it's a core quality metric**

- Follow usability heuristics from `agents/UX_PRINCIPLES.md`
- Verify all user-facing features against UX checklist
- Ensure accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA minimum)
- Test with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- Provide clear error messages with actionable next steps
- Make agent actions transparent and user-controllable

---

## Implementation Checklist

Before marking any task complete:

- [ ] Read the task file thoroughly
- [ ] Understand requirements and acceptance criteria
- [ ] Review relevant architecture docs
- [ ] Review UX principles if implementing user-facing features
- [ ] Implement following mode-specific instructions
- [ ] Extract business logic to services
- [ ] Write/update tests
- [ ] Verify UX quality (usability heuristics, accessibility, error handling)
- [ ] Browser test all user-facing features (mandatory - verify in actual browser)- [ ] Run all tests and verify they pass
- [ ] Run linter and fix issues
- [ ] Build project and verify success
- [ ] Update documentation if needed
- [ ] Provide implementation summary (what changed, what users can now do, what's pending)
- [ ] Verify all Definition of Done criteria met

## Mode Selection Guide

**Is the task exploratory?**
- Yes ‚Üí Use Prototyping Instructions
- No ‚Üí Continue below

**Are requirements clear and validated?**
- Yes ‚Üí Use Implementation Instructions  
- No ‚Üí Ask Product Manager to clarify requirements

**Is this a bug fix?**
- Always use Implementation Instructions (production code quality)

**Is this a refactor?**
- Always use Implementation Instructions (full testing required)
